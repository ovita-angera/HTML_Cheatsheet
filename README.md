### HTML practice

Create a cheatsheet while exploring different markup features in html

selectors = id, class
tags have attributes when declared
meta for metadata used to define metadata details for the site to be consumed by search engines

Css -  static pages (stick to)
Know position and element
Know display on the DOM

types of display: inline, block, flex, inline-block

position: absolute, relative, 

pseudo classes input - `: attribute`

JS: 
1. Data Structures and Algortihms - List, Array, Object, String, Integer, Float, Double, Arrays, Hashmaps
2. Object Oriented Programming (O.O.P)
