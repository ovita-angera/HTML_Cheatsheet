                    The 2021 Crypto.com ad aired during the Super Bowl and was called 
                    ‘Fortune Favors the Brave’. ‘History is filled with almosts,’ says 
                    the actor Matt Damon, gliding through a museum set like an eager docent, 
                    ‘with those who “almost” adventured, who “almost” achieved, but ultimately 
                    for them it proved to be too much.’ He halts reflectively at an effigy of 
                    Ferdinand Magellan dissolving into the waves. ‘Then,’ he says, moving swiftly 
                    on to the other, more inspiring exhibits (a climber, a Wright brother, two replicants 
                    kissing in a night club, a troupe of racially diverse astronauts stepping proudly onto 
                    a gangway in a scene from nowhere in history), ‘there are others, the ones who embrace 
                    the moment and commit. And, in those moments of truth, these men and women, these 
                    mere mortals – just like you and me – as they peer over the edge, they calm their 
                    minds and steel their nerves with four simple words that have been whispered by 
                    the intrepid since the time of the Romans: “Fortune favors the brave.”’
